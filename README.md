# Pyaon - Python Wrapper for the Aon C++ library

This is a Python package that provides a wrapper for the AON C++ library. It
allows users to access the functionality of the C++ library from Python code.

The AON library is a fast and efficient library that provides a set of
algorithms for analyzing and manipulating data. The Python wrapper provides a
convenient interface for Python developers who want to use the AON library in
their projects.

## Installation

The AON Python Wrapper can be installed via pip:

```python
pip install pyaon
```

## Usage

To use the AON Python Wrapper in your Python code, start by importing the
module:

```python
import aon
...
```

From here, you can use the functions provided by the
[AON library](https://github.com/Tomcat-42/aon). The Python wrapper provides an
interface for all of the functions in the AON library, so consult the AON
documentation for details on how to use the individual functions.
